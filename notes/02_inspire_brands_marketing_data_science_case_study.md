## Role: Data Scientist, Marketing @ Inspire Brands LLC
**Objective:** Develop customer segments to inform marketing strategies around recent trends in sustainability, plant-based options, and digital engagement.

### Step 1: Clarify Objectives
1. **Business Goals**  
   - What specific trends or goals should the segmentation address? Potential areas include increasing digital engagement, promoting plant-based options, or encouraging loyalty program use.
   - Is this analysis brand-specific (e.g., Dunkin’ or Arby’s) or should it focus on customers across Inspire Brands?
   - Are there specific campaigns (e.g., time-sensitive promotions, app features) that would benefit from this segmentation?

### Step 2: Define the Key Objective
After clarifying objectives, we’ll focus on segmenting customers across Inspire Brands who are engaged with plant-based options, sustainable packaging initiatives, and app-based loyalty programs. The aim is to assist the marketing team in creating campaigns aligned with these recent trends.

### Step 4: Methodology

1. **Data Preparation**
   - **Data Sources:** Collect purchase data (item type, frequency), app usage, website visits, loyalty program engagement, and demographic information (e.g., age, location).
   - **Trend-Specific Data:** Include data points related to plant-based promotions, sustainable packaging usage, and app-based loyalty program activity.

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Create features to capture recent trends, such as:
     - Frequency of app orders and engagement with sustainable product categories (e.g., plant-based items).
     - Loyalty program usage, digital coupon redemption, and frequency of plant-based menu orders.
   - These features help reveal customers’ alignment with recent trends.

3. **Segmentation Analysis**
   - **Clustering Techniques:** Apply methods like K-Means or hierarchical clustering to segment customers based on the features. Use the Silhouette or Elbow Method to determine optimal clusters.
   - **Cluster Interpretation:** Identify meaningful personas, such as “Eco-Conscious App Users” or “High-Frequency Plant-Based Buyers,” by analyzing each cluster’s descriptive statistics.

4. **Cluster Insights**
   - Interpret each cluster to pinpoint core traits. For example:
     - **Eco-Conscious App User:** A customer group that orders frequently via the app, redeems sustainable item promotions, and aligns with plant-based trends.

### Step 5: Business Application & Recommendations
- **Targeted Campaigns:** Based on the segments, Inspire Brands can:
   - Send customized offers to “Eco-Conscious App Users” for new plant-based items or reward sustainable purchase behavior in the app.
   - Promote app features to high-frequency, in-store buyers, encouraging digital engagement and rewards program benefits.

This segmentation approach enables Inspire Brands’ Marketing team to align campaigns with customer preferences, tapping into trends in sustainability and digital interaction to enhance engagement and loyalty.
